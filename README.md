# Project Overview

This project is a combination of Vite, React, and Typescript. It demonstrates the implementation of a virtualized list using the react-window library. API handling is done using react-query and Axios. For stylings, CSS modules have been utilized.

## Running and Testing in a Local Environment

#### yarn

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Application Structure & Features Implementation

The application is structured with an emphasis on modularity and readability. Each feature has been carefully implemented, taking into consideration best practices for coding standards, performance optimizations, and user experience.

## Pros:

- The use of Vite allows for lightning-fast cold server start.
- React provides an efficient way to build user interfaces.
- Typescript ensures type safety throughout the project.
- The react-window library optimizes rendering for long lists and tabular data.
- React-query provides an excellent solution for fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state.
- Axios makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints.
- CSS Modules allow for modular and reusable CSS styling.

## Cons:

- As with any technology or library, there might be a learning curve involved especially if one is not familiar with them.
